Description: It checks the heaviness of a package's dependencies, i.e. number of 
    additional packages that are required for each of the direct dependency packages. 
    For each package listed in the "Depends", "Imports", "LinkingTo", "Suggests" and
    "Enhances" fields in the DESCRIPTION file, it checks how many additional packages 
    it brings in. The summary of the dependency is visualized by a customized heatmap.
    It also additionally creates a website that contains global package dependency
    analysis for all packages on CRAN and Bioconductor (retrieved on 2021-10-28).
