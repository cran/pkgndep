Description: A new metric named 'dependency heaviness' is proposed that measures the number 
    of additional dependency packages that a parent package brings to its child package 
    and are unique to the dependency packages imported by all other parents.  
    The dependency heaviness analysis is visualized by a customized heatmap. 
    The package is described in <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btac449>. We have also performed 
    the dependency heaviness analysis on the CRAN/Bioconductor package ecosystem and the results 
    are implemented as a web-based database which provides comprehensive tools for 
    querying dependencies of individual R packages.
